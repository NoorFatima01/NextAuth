# Authentication in Next.js Project

## `useSession` Hook

The `useSession()` hook is used to access session data on the client side. When the session changes, the `useSession()` hook will automatically update the session data. It returns a session object that contains the user object and other information. The session object will be `null` if the user is not authenticated.

### Session Object Properties

The session object contains the following properties:

- `user`: The user object returned by the authentication provider.
- `expires`: The timestamp in milliseconds when the session expires.
- `accessToken`: The access token for the authentication provider.
- `refreshToken`: The refresh token for the authentication provider.
- `idToken`: The ID token for the authentication provider.
- `jwt`: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for the session.
- `jwtPayload`: The decoded JWT payload for the session.
- `error`: An error object if there was an error.
- `loading`: A boolean value that is true if the session is being fetched.
- `data`: The session object returned by the server.
- ... and more.

## `getServerSession` Function

`getServerSession` is used to get the session data at the time the server is processing a request. It will return the session data as it exists at that moment, but it will not continue to monitor the session for changes.

## Tokens Explanation

### Access Token

An access token is a credential used by an application to access an API. Its purpose is to inform the API that the bearer of this token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions.

### Refresh Token

A refresh token is a special kind of token used to obtain a renewed access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. This is useful for extending sessions.

### ID Token

An ID token is a JWT that contains claims about the identity of the authenticated user, providing information such as username, email, and other profile information.
